Ever want to figure out how long it'll take you to do an RNG in Pokemon but don't want to mess with 3DSRNGTool or don't want to wait a while for it to calculate? This simple calculator can calculate how long it will take you to reach your target frame given your current frame and other factors like NPCs and fidgeting in Generations 6 and 7. Generation 3 is not supported, but if I receive requests, that may change in the future. This program is currently work in progress.
